<h2>DMTK - Dungeon Masters Tool Kit</h2>

This application is meant for use by a Dungeon Master (DM) in the 
tabletop RPG Dungeons and Dragons. With the app, DMs can keep track of various 
elements of their game.

Examples of this include:
    <ul>
        <li>Player information</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Name, Class, Health, active statuses, inventories, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Currently used NPCs and enemies and their traits</li>
    </ul> 

This app is meant to aid in the fluidity of the job as DM, and make games run as
smoothly as possible.
